    <h1>Project Experience</h1>

    <!-- Traffic Light Controller, 270 Lab Project -->
    <h2>Traffic Light Controller - October 2023</h2>
    <!-- find a way to get rid of the line break between these two sections -->
    <p>
        I designed the logic implementation for a Traffic Light Controller, based on a set of specifications, as part of a class on Logic Design.
        <br>
        This included the design of a state machine, and the implementation of the state machine using a hardware description language, VHDL.
        <br>
        This was interfaced by an FPGA Board, where the switches acted as the sensors for each lane, and the state of each light was displayed on the HEX displays.
    </p>

    <!-- Account Database Self-Made Project -->
    <h2>Account Database - May 2023</h2>
    <!-- find a way to get rid of the line break between these two sections -->
    <p>
        I undertook the design and implementation of an Account Database Management System as a personal project, using my C++ programming skills.
        <br>
        I hoped to refine my design skills, and get more experience finishing a project from the very beginning to end. 
    </p>

    <!-- SillyQL 281 Project -->
    <h2>Modified SQL Database - March 2023</h2>
    <!-- find a way to get rid of the line break between these two sections -->
    <p>
        As part of a class on Data Structures and Algorithms, I was tasked with constructing a custom SQL database, implemented in C++, to meet a set of performance and functionality
        specifications.
        <br>
        Important aspects of this project include effecient searching, printing, deleting, and joining of tables. Tables are implemented using the standard library hash tables, which enables
        sorting and filtering using binary tree indices to optimize search algorithms, making deletion or output of specific rows much faster.
        <br>
        A unique characteristic of this custom SQL implementation is the ability to join two tables together. This functionality gives the opportunity to find the intersection of two datasets,
        and prints the specified rows and values to the terminal. There is a demo of these functionalities below.

    <!-- Raspberry Pi Adblocker -->
    <h2>Raspberry Pi Wireless Ad-Blocker - April 2021</h2>
    <!-- find a way to get rid of the line break between these two sections -->
    <p>
        During High School, I decided to learn about programming Raspberry Pis, and I decided to make a wireless ad-blocker that would block all the ads on my home internet.
        <br>
        I did this using a Raspberry Pi 3, and the Pi-Hole software. I learned about how to use Linux, and how DNS Servers work.

    <h1>Leadership Experience</h1>

    <h2>Best Buy Sales Advisor: May 2021 - August 2023</h2>
    <!-- find a way to get rid of the line break between these two sections -->
    <p>
        I started my sales experience at Best Buy, where I worked as a Sales Advisor, helping customers find the products they were looking for, and made sure their purchase decisions where informed.
        <br>
        I quickly picked up on the skills needed to be a successful salesperson, and I was able to train new employees on good practices.
        <br>
        In addition, I successfuly learned about the tasks completed by the warehouse team, and worked both positions when needed. On days when the warehouse manager was not scheduled, I oversaw operations like order management, restocking, and reorganization of the store.
    </p>

    <h2>Digital Signal Processor Project Team - March 2022</h2>
    <!-- find a way to get rid of the line break between these two sections -->
    <p>
        As part of an introductory engineering course, I put together a team of 4 students to design and implement a Digital Signal Processor, which accomplished a task of our choice.
        <br>
        We came up with a few ideas, and in order to make sure everyone was happy with our project, I came up with an idea of how to combine all of our ideas into one project.
        <br>
        Our project involved programming a synthesizer, transcriber, and a "teacher" of sorts. The synthesizer allows users to play music directly from the UI, with two octaves of notes, and their choice of note duration.
        The transcriber takes in any given audio file, and display the pitches on a stem plot.
        <br>
        The teaching software displays the pitches of a song, and the user would play the displayed song. Next, the teaching software would calculate the user's accuracy, and give them a score of how accurately they played the music.

    <h2>Varsity Basketball, Soccer: August 2018 - March 2021</h2>
    <!-- find a way to get rid of the line break between these two sections -->
    <p>
        I played Varsity Basketball and Soccer for my High School, and achieved captain for Basketball, both Junior and Senior year.
        In addition, I was awarded with all conference in both Basketball and Soccer during my Senior year.
        <br>
        I learned some very valuable lessons in how to be a good leader and teammate, and how to work with a team to accomplish a goal.
