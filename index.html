    <h1>Project Experience</h1>

    <!-- Traffic Light Controller, 270 Lab Project -->
    <h2>Traffic Light Controller - October 2023</h2>
    <!-- find a way to get rid of the line break between these two sections -->
    <p>
        I designed the logic implementation for a Traffic Light Controller, based on a set of specifications, as part of a class on Logic Design.
        <br>
        This included the design of a state machine, and the implementation of the state machine using a hardware description language, VHDL.
        <br>
        This was interfaced by an FPGA Board, where the switches acted as the sensors for each lane, and the state of each light was displayed on the HEX displays.

    <!-- Account Database Self-Made Project -->
    <h2>Account Database - May 2023</h2>
    <!-- find a way to get rid of the line break between these two sections -->
    <p>
        I undertook the design and implementation of an Account Database Management System as a personal project, using my C++ programming skills.
        <br>
        I hoped to refine my design skills, and get more experience finishing a project from the very beginning to end.

    <!-- SillyQL 281 Project -->
    <h2>Modified SQL Database - March 2023</h2>
    <!-- find a way to get rid of the line break between these two sections -->
    <p>
        As part of a class on Data Structures and Algorithms, I was tasked with constructing a custom SQL database, implemented in C++, to meet a set of performance and functionality
        specifications.
        <br>
        Important aspects of this project include effecient searching, printing, deleting, and joining of tables. Tables are implemented using the standard library hash tables, which enables
        sorting and filtering using binary tree indices to optimize search algorithms, making deletion or output of specific rows much faster.
        <br>
        A unique characteristic of this custom SQL implementation is the ability to join two tables together. This functionality gives the opportunity to find the intersection of two datasets,
        and prints the specified rows and values to the terminal. There is a demo of these functionalities below.

    <!-- Raspberry Pi Adblocker -->
    <h2>Raspberry Pi Wireless Ad-Blocker - April 2021</h2>
    <!-- find a way to get rid of the line break between these two sections -->
    <p>
        During High School, I decided to learn about programming Raspberry Pis, and I decided to make a wireless ad-blocker that would block all the ads on my home internet.
        <br>
        I did this using a Raspberry Pi 3, and the Pi-Hole software. I learned about how to use Linux, and how DNS Servers work.
